# Lava_Floor
ARKit - Plane detection code.
This application detects the horizontal plane and adds a lava.png image to it which grows as the app detects more of it.
Lessons learnt - setting up ARKit, configuration, debug options, setting up showWorldOrigin and FeaturePoints, using the ARSCNViewDelegate
and adding the rendering methods didAdd(), didUpdate() and didRemove(). Also incorperated a method for converting degrees into radians.
